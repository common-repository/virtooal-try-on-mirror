The Virtual mirror allows the shoppers to experience all decorative cosmetics, sunglasses, contact lenses, jewelry, 
and accessories using their own photos or photos of models. It is suitable for all shops. 
The editing process of the profile picture works as a process of auto-detection of the face and its features (lips, eyes, etc.), 
no real time editing needed.

== Description ==

**[Auglio](https://auglio.com/)** team with the base in London has been developing AR technology since 2008. It focuses on bringing the Virtual TRY-ON into web browsers as its plugins are integrated directly into fashion and beauty e-commerce websites.

The last advantage street stores had over online stores is now a thing of the past! With Auglio’s Virtual Try-On, customers can try on products directly from the comfort of their homes, using their webcams. Give your customers realistic shopping experiences with Virtual Try-On! Augmented reality designed for eyewear, fashion, and cosmetics stores brings fun to online shopping.

This Virtual Try-On is a plugin that can be integrated into e-commerce websites by embedding a short HTML code. The try-on has several parts. A floating icon in the bottom corner of the page and a “Try On” button that triggers the mirror and puts the product on the customers’ photos or directly on their face in the live camera version.
